# Winnipeg CAD Monitor - Native Mobile App

A **real native mobile app** for monitoring Winnipeg's emergency dispatch system with **emergency audio alerts that bypass silent mode**.

## üö® **Why Native App?**

Web browsers have strict limitations that prevent emergency audio from playing when phones are on silent. This native app solves that problem by:

- ‚úÖ **Playing emergency audio even in silent mode**
- ‚úÖ **Strong vibration patterns that work reliably**
- ‚úÖ **Background monitoring with push notifications**
- ‚úÖ **Proper system-level audio permissions**
- ‚úÖ **Keep screen awake during monitoring**

## üì± **Features**

- **Background operation**: Continues monitoring even when app is minimized
- **Push notifications**: System-level notifications for critical incidents

### **Real-Time Monitoring**
- **Live CAD data**: Direct connection to Winnipeg's official dispatch system
- **Instant alerts**: Immediate notification of critical incidents
